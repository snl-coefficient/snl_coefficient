Tina Fey, one of the most successful comedians to find their start on *Saturday Night Live*, began her foray into the film industry while still behind the Weekend Update desk in Studio 8H. The filming of *Mean Girls* (2004)  coincided with the start of season 29 of *SNL*; after the show ended at 1 a.m, Fey rode 8.5 hours to the film set in Toronto for breakfast on Sunday morning.[^1]

It isn't surprising, then, that *SNL* is cited so frequently in the film's reviews, whether as praise for Fey herself ("...a live wire: a sexy "Weekend Update" funny girl who rarely sends out a joke without a sting in its tail... brings her sass as an actress and a writer...") or in reference to the presence of Lorne Michaels as producer.[^2]

It is standard, to refer to the work that a writer/actor/director/producer is best known for at the time of a project's release. *Anchorman* (2004) came two years after star Will Ferrell's departure from *SNL* but still drew comparison: Empire claimed the film had the "hit-and-miss quality of an extended *Saturday Night Live* sketch."[^3]

Yet, 15 years after Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf left *SNL*, mentions of the show continued to spring up in reviews of *Grown Ups* (2010), suggesting that a comedian's presence on *SNL* might be more akin to a graduate degree in comedy rather than a simple comedy project on their resume.[^4] Drawing from this shared educational experience, how does the network of SNL stars and alums collaborate during and after their time on the show?

## What is an *SNL* film?

In the past half century, *SNL* gave birth to an industry of spin-offs: albums, books, "Best of" television specials, and most relevant to this essay, films. In various rankings of "*SNL* films," lists can range from 11 to 14 movies.[^5] Standards for inclusion appear to be:

1.  Derived from a sketch first appearing on *SNL* (see: *Wayne's World* (1992))

2.  Released outside of the confines of Studio 8H (see: *Gilda Live* (1980))

3.  Involving *SNL* cast members, past and/or present (see: *Coneheads* (1993))

Other standards are difficult to tie down without eliminating (or including) certain projects. Does it need the involvement of Lorne Michaels or other *SNL* producers? Eliminate *Blues Brothers* (1980). Does it need to include all of the same cast members as the original sketch? Eliminate *Blues Brothers 2000* (2000). Does it need to be a feature length film? If not, *The David S. Pumpkins Halloween Special* (2017) belongs somewhere in the line up.

These standards, however, exclude the plethora of films that arguably wouldn't exist as we know them without *Saturday Night Live*: *Mean Girls*, *Anchorman*, and *Grown Ups* to name a few. While near-universally recognized *SNL* media spike in the late 1990s, there are arguably more ensemble comedy films and television series (30 Rock comes immediately to mind) that owe some degree of patronage to their late night television school of thought. To best represent this concept -- a film or television show or media project's relationship to *Saturday Night Live*'s sphere of influence, we developed the ** *SNL* Coefficient**.

## Calculating The SNL Coefficient

This project involves two types of *SNL* Coefficients: one for *SNL* cast members and writers to determine a person's relationship to the show, and one for SNL media to determine a piece of media's relationship to the show. 

### SNL Alums Coefficient

Using sources from IMDB, Wikipedia, and dedicated *SNL* fans, we identified credited *SNL* cast members and writers (referred to collectively in this article as *SNL* alums). After confirming their role on the show, we collected additional data regarding active years on the show, (including breaks), the number of seasons of their involvement as actors and writers. Special consideration was given to those directly involved in the "Weekend Update" segment -- a guaranteed weekly presence on the show -- as well as those who have returned to host the show since their "graduation."

Once this dataset was compiled, we found the IMDB pages for each *SNL* alum, scraping their entire filmography. We reviewed these credits to filter for media properties that were released during or after the alum's stint on *SNL*, and for which the alum was credited as writer, director, producer, actor/actress, self, or present in archival footage. Any media property that involved two or more SNL alums was considered to be "*SNL*-related media".

Using the additional information we'd collected from IMDB regarding their time with SNL, we calculated a coefficient for each *SNL* alum using the following formula: 

-   10% Number of Episodes Hosted (number of episodes hosted/number of most hosted times)

-   10% Best Of

-   15% Number of Episodes with Weekend Update

-   15% Number of Seasons as Head Writer

-   25% Number of Episodes (46% Credited on Show as Actor, 44% Credited on Show as Writer, 10% for Other Credits)

-   25% Number of Seasons (46% Credited on Show as Actor, 44% Credited on Show as Writer, 10% for Other Credits)

Acting credits are weighted slightly more heavily in the formula, given that actors also serve as uncredited writers throughout the season and are more visibly associated with the show from a general audience perspective.) We recognize there are limitations with this system - Lorne Michaels, for example, would have a middling coefficient had we not given him a base coefficient of 1. This formula also relies heavily on quantity of *SNL* associations, as opposed to quality, and heavily favors more recent alums who have stayed on the show for longer periods of times than alums who were on the show in its early years.

For example (as of publication): 

-   Tina Fey has hosted *SNL* 6 times between YYYY and YYYY. 

-   Fey does not have a Best Of compilation, so she is given a value of 0. 

-   Fey has hosted "Weekend Update" on 117 episodes. 

-   Fey has served 7 seasons as head writer. 

-   Fey has been involved in XX episodes, including XX as actor, XX as writer, and XX for other. 

-   Fey served 9 seasons on the show from 1997 to 2006: 6 as an actor (5 as repertory player and 1 as featured player) and 9 as writer (7 as head writer). 

-   Fey has a coefficient of XX.


### SNL Media Coefficient

For any *SNL*-related media, we scraped additional information from IMDB about the media's genres, number of episodes, principal cast and crew, and production companies. We then calculated a movie coefficient for each "*SNL*-related media" property using the following formula: 

-   For each *SNL* alum credit in the *SNL*-related media, we weighted their coefficient based on involvement in the property (percentage of episodes). For movies or other non-episodic media, the percentage of episodes is 1. If the alum served a particularly important role in the property (one of the principal cast/crew or a producer), their value was multiplied by a role coefficient of 2.

-   The sum of these *SNL* alum values was increased by a value of 5 if the *SNL*-related media was directly associated with *SNL* (a "Best Of" compilation, a spin off, a movie based on an *SNL* sketch, etc.)

-   The sum was then divided by the number of *SNL* credits associated with the show, before being multiplied by the number of alums who participated.

For example:

*Mean Girls* involved 5 *SNL* alumni: Ana Gasteyer, Lorne Michaels, Amy Poehler, Tim Meadows, and Tina Fey. Fey is credited twice (as writer and performer) and so her coefficient will be considered twice. 
```
< AG + LM + AP + TM + TF + TF >
```
Since this is a movie, their coefficients are each multiplied by 1. 
```
< AG + LM + AP + TM + TF + TF >
```
Only Tina Fey (screenplay and star) is considered a principal person (though Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, and Ana Gasteyer have top-billing and Lorne is a producer). Her coefficient is multiplied by 2 for each credit. 
```
< AG + LM + AP + TM + (TF*2) +( TF*2) >
```
*Mean Girls* was not directly associated with SNL, so there is no increased value. 
```
< AG + LM + AP + TM + (TF*2) +( TF*2)  + 0 >
```
At the time of writing, the sum of the coefficients equaled XX. Divided by 6 (the number of *SNL* alumni credits), and then multiplied by 5 (the number of *SNL* alumni), the coefficient then equals XX. 
```
((AG + LM + AP + TM + (TF*2) +( TF*2) )/6)/5 = coefficient
```

### Highlights 

#### From exploring the *SNL* Alums Coefficient: 

There are XXX SNL alums over the course of the 47-year run. The *SNL* Coefficient provides a metric into how heavy the show's influence is on the trajectory of an individual's career. 

Individuals with highest coefficients

- Tina Fey reigns supreme, with a coefficient of .244. Others at the top include Michael Che, Colin Jost, Michael McKean, James Downey (I), and Michael O'Donoghue. 
-  Other box-office heavy hitters - Sandler & Ferrell - fall in the top 20% of SNL alumni based on coefficients. 
-   Excluding Michaels, the average coefficient for an SNL alum is XX (writers vs. actors?). As expected, this is slightly higher for those who are predominantly actors. 
- The cohort with the highest average coefficient is XX, which features alums such as ... 

#### From exploring the *SNL* Media Coefficient: 

Of the XXXX filmography credits scraped from alums IMDB pages, only XXXX were considered eligible by our initial standards (what we consider **potential** *SNL* media.) And of that XXXX, XXX had a coefficient over 1, making this small dataset definitively SNL media. 

-   Only 29 TV series meet the qualifications of definitive *SNL* media, 4 of which are already "*SNL*-related media". All of these fall into the Comedy genre - think *Portlandia*, *30 Rock*, *Shrill*, and *Schmigadoon*!

-   Only 1 podcast fits the bill: *Heads Will Roll* (2020).

- Broadway Video films:

- SNL Feature Films: 

- Sandler films: Adam Sandler is known for casting his fellow *SNL* alums in films. 8 of Happy Madison Productions meet SNL film criteria, and most of them come after the release of Grown Ups (2010). 

- High Profile SNL films that don't make the cut (Bridesmaids)

Saturday Night Live is a comedic show, but what are the implications of transcending those genre divisions?

#### Common Collaborators

-   Provides insight into the development of projects, particularly when it is the first non-SNL collaboration between individuals

## Conclusion

Saturday Night Live is self-aware of its longstanding impact on its alumni and the broader entertainment industry with the presence of the "Five-Timers Club" sketches for oft-returning hosts and highly anticipated episodes with returning cast members as hosts or guest stars, as seen with Maya Rudolph's portrayal of Kamala Harris.[^6]

For industry professionals, the data may provide hope that networking with an individual with a higher SNL coefficient might provide access to a wealth of connections -- the authors of this article provide no guarantees about this path.

For academics and fans of the show, the data provides a starting point about the post-SNL prospects and opportunities available to alums of the show and aspiring comics. SNL, while oft researched for its influence on political events or its challenges to gender representation, started as a challenge to the comedy industry. But looking at the networks and media-making opportunities created as offshoots of Saturday Night Live, we can see that certain generations of actors have fueled some of the most successful comedy films and television series of the past decades using their SNL connections

Nick Marx, an associate professor of film and media studies at Colorado State University, proposed that SNL is today a "nexus between two talent pools": up-and-coming comedians trying to attract attention and established comedians satiating an audience demand for content.[^7] With more forms of popular media available to performers today than ever before, from webseries to Hollywood films to television shows on a dozen different streaming services, expanding the SNL media universe is a critical step forwards in media analysis.
